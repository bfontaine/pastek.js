This is a live editor for Pastek. Here are the basics:

* Add `emphasis` on a piece of text by surrounding it with two backquotes
* Strong ``text`` is surrounded by two backquotes on each side
* Write ```code``` surrounded by <code>\`\`\`</code>
* If you are crazy, you can mix ``strong, `emphasis, and even ```code``` ` ``
* Make titles with one to six ```#``` (like Markdown)
* Use ```*``` for lists, and add more ```*```s to make
** a sub-list
*** and another one
* Shortcuts to common math symbols are available. For example,  ```&a``` gives &a, while ```&l``` gives &l and ```&p``` gives &p. You can use html entities if you prefere, as &gamma;.
* Subscripts and superscripts are supported with the same syntax as Latex. use  ```_``` for subscripts (e.g. x_i) and ```^``` for superscripts (e.g. x^2). You also may want to superscript^{awholesentence}
* You can even make simple tables:
+-----+-----+
| Foo | Bar |
+-----+-----+
| &p^2 | 42 |
| bla|bli|
+-----+-----+
* Characters are escaped with a backslash (\\)
* Comments are written using OCaml syntax, which allows you to nest them  (* Here is a comment (* and a nested one *) :) *)
* Write html code, and it will be include as written. <b>Like that !</b>
* That's it!
