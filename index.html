This is a live editor for Pastek. Here are the basics:

* Add `emphasis` on a piece of text by surrounding it with two backquotes
* Strong ``text`` is surrounded by two backquotes on each side
* Make titles with one to six `#` (like Markdown)
* Write ```code``` surrounded by <code>\`\`\`</code>
* Use ```*``` for lists, and add more ```*```s to make
** a sub-list
*** and another one
* Shortcuts to common math symbols are available. For example, <!--
--> ```&a``` gives &a, while ```&l``` gives &l and ```&p``` gives &p.
* Subscripts and superscripts are supported with the same syntax as Latex. use <!--
--> ```_``` for subscripts (e.g. x_i) and ```^``` for superscripts (e.g. x^2).
* You can even make simple tables:
+-----+-----+
| Foo | Bar |
+-----+-----+
| &p^2 | 42 |
+-----+-----+
* Characters are escaped with a backslash
* Comments are written using OCaml syntax, which allows you to nest them <!--
--> (* Here is a comment (* and a nested one *) :) *)
* That's it!
